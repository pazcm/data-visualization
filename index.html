            <p>The area between the opening and closing tag is called a <em>viewport</em>.</p>
            <p>And in that viewport, you can define child elements, which are shapes, such as rectangle, circle, ... paths, text,...</p>
            <p>For example: a rectangle (like other HTML element has attributes, and by default the graphic will be black as the text.)</p>
